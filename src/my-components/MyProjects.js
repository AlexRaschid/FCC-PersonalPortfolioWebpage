Right now its possible distasteful, nsfw, or non-pc to be thrown into the mix based on the API call. I had tried to filter it out with modifiers on the URL from where i got the key, but they dont seem to do anything.`

We built this project by using HTML,CSS and javascript. The challenges we ran into is how to get the display to look like real programming sites with the numbers and in the javascript we had some problems with names and code, it was everywhere so it was hard to reorganized it We learned a lot with a text editor libary called ACE and we learned how to create keywords in the program and transform the keywords into javascript What's next with this project is to incorporate more software languages with text editors and add in a better system so people are able to understand how code work more easily"
